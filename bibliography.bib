	abstract = {We analyze the behavior of quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) building blocks in the presence of random cell displacements. The QCA cells are modeled using the coherence vector description and simulated using QCADesigner. We evaluate various fundamental circuits: the wire, the inverter, the majority gate, and the two-wire crossing approaches: the coplanar crossover and the multilayer crossover. Our results show that different building blocks have different displacement tolerances. The coplanar crossover and inverter perform the weakest. The wire is the most robust. We have found displacement tolerances to be a function of circuit layout and geometry rather than cell size.},

	abstract = {Field-coupled Nanocomputing&nbsp;(FCN) technologies provide an alternative to conventional CMOS-based computation technologies and are characterized by intriguingly low-energy dissipation. Accordingly, their design received significant attention in the recent past. FCN circuit implementations like Quantum-dot Cellular Automata&nbsp;(QCA) or Nanomagnet Logic&nbsp;(NML) have already been built in labs and basic operations such as inverters, Majority, AND, OR, and so on,&nbsp;are already available. The design problem basically boils down to the question of how to place basic operations and route their connections so that the desired function results while, at the same time, further constraints (related to timing, clocking, path lengths, etc.) are satisfied. While several solutions for this problem have been proposed, interestingly no clear understanding about the complexity of the underlying task exists thus far. In this research note, we consider this problem and eventually prove that placement and routing for tile-based FCN circuits is NP-complete. By this, we provide a theoretical foundation for the further development of corresponding design methods.},
