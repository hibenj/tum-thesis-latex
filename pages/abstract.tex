New technologies to compete with CMOS, one of them QCA \\
Placement and Routing as key to producibility. \\
Challenges of Placement and Routing in previous algorithms. \\
Goals of this work: \\I minimizing area/tiles, \\II making it possible to place majority-gates (which is a promising aspect of QCA), \\III making it possible to P\&R sequential circuits \\
This is done by introducing several signal distribution networks \\
Results are compared with already existing algorithms...
