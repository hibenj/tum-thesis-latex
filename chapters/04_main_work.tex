\section{Input Network}
Reduces area and wire crossings.\\
Sorts the inputs.\\
Idea is simple place Fanout nodes at the beginning since they produce the most crossings\\
Needs a conditional east west coloring.\\

\section{Majority Gates Placement Network}
Reference to the importance of this part in the QCA technology. \\
Point out that 2DD-Wave is still used but clocking scheme is adjusted to place majority gates.\\
This is why buffers have to be used.\\
Point out the overhead that is produced by buffers.\\
Maybe assumption why it doesn't make sense to only use RES. (you lose really much space for the cells which are no majority gates)


\section{Sequential Circuits Placement}

Importance of sequential circuits.\\
Point out how the registers are implemented.\\
Show how the distribution network is generated, where Ris and Ros are placed and how they are treated within the network.\\
Make clear that this implementation is slowing down the circuit significantly.
